# <img src="https://s2.loli.net/2025/04/18/RWaFJkY4gSDLViy.png" alt="Minecraft AI" width="36" height="36"> Minecraft AI-Python: An Open Framework for Building Embodied AI in Minecraft

Minecraft AI-Python is a modular framework designed to support the creation and customization of AI Characters (AICs) within Minecraft environments. It provides a stable and extensible interface for perception, action, communication, memory, and reflection—enabling complex individual and multi-agent behaviors.

**The Embodied Turing Test** rather than asking "Can machines think?", Minecraft AI invites a new question for the generative AI era: Can machines play with us? Through open-ended interaction, emergent behaviors, and shared creativity, we explore whether AI can truly engage as a companion—not just in conversation, but in fun, imagination, and collaborative world-building.

> The [Minecraft AI Emobodied Benchmark](https://minecraft-ai-embodied-benchmark.megrez.plus/) Benchmark is a hierarchical evaluation framework designed to measure the embodied intelligence of AI agents in Minecraft. It organizes all in-game advancements into progressive levels, allowing researchers and developers to assess an agent’s cognitive and interactive abilities — from basic survival skills to complex multi-step planning and collaboration. Each level represents a milestone in autonomy, perception, and reasoning within a persistent, open-ended environment, providing a structured path for developing and comparing Minecraft-based AI systems.

This project is part of the broader Minecraft AI ecosystem. While the original [Minecraft AI](https://github.com/aeromechanic000/minecraft-ai) project focuses on a JavaScript-based infrastructure with integrated components, minecraft-ai-python emphasizes simplicity, flexibility, and rapid development in Python. It is ideal for educational experiments, prototyping research ideas, and custom agent development by individual contributors.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy: Cognitive Metabolism

Traditional AI agents operate on a **Linear Execution** model: they wait for input, process it, and produce output. This works well for chatbots, but falls short for embodied agents that should feel "alive" in a persistent world.

Minecraft AI-Python introduces **Cognitive Metabolism** — a cyclic model where the agent continuously thinks, plans, and acts, even without player input.

### From Linear to Cyclic

```
Traditional Agent:          Cognitive Metabolism:
                            ┌─────────────────────┐
Input → Process → Output    │   IDLE → REFLECT    │
                            │     ↑         ↓     │
                            │     ACT   ←  PLAN   │
                            └─────────────────────┘
```

Instead of being reactive-only, the agent proactively generates its own goals, reflects on its situation, and takes initiative — much like a living creature.

### Core Principles

**1. Emergent Identity**

The agent's personality isn't just a prompt — it's a seed that grows into a unique identity. If `longterm_thinking` is empty, the agent generates its own aspirations from the profile during the "Foundational Reflection" on first spawn. This identity then influences all future decisions, creating consistency and depth.

**2. Handshake Protocol**

Autonomy without alignment is chaos. When the agent wants to do something self-driven, it announces its intent:

> "[Proposal] I want to explore the caves to the north. I'll proceed in 30 seconds unless you have other plans."

This creates a collaborative dynamic: the agent takes initiative but remains responsive to player direction. Any player message cancels the proposal, keeping the human in the loop.

**3. Persistent Memory & Goals**

The agent remembers past interactions, maintains relationships with players, and tracks long-term goals. If interrupted (e.g., server restart), it resumes where it left off:

> "I'm resuming: building the farmhouse foundation."

This persistence creates the illusion of a continuous conscious experience.

**4. Reflective Self-Improvement**

Through periodic self-reflection, the agent:
- Summarizes recent experiences into memory
- Updates its understanding of player relationships
- Adjusts its `longterm_thinking` based on significant events
- Derives lessons from successes and failures

This isn't just memory — it's learning and character development.

### Why This Matters

For the **Embodied Turing Test**, the question isn't "Can AI think?" but "Can AI play with us?" A true gaming companion should:

- **Take initiative** — not just wait for commands
- **Have personality** — consistent behavior that reflects a unique character
- **Stay aligned** — autonomous but not uncontrolled
- **Remember and grow** — relationships and skills that develop over time

Cognitive Metabolism is our approach to creating agents that feel alive — not just intelligent, but present.

## 🚀 Quick Start 

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the `minecraft-ai-python` system.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository into your working directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aeromechanic000/minecraft-ai-python.git
cd minecraft-ai-python
```

Make sure you're in the `minecraft-ai-python` directory before continuing.

### 2. Install Prerequisites

#### 2.1 Install Node Modules

From the root of the `minecraft-ai` directory, install the required Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies into the `node_modules` directory.

> 💡 **Note on Patches**
> If you plan to apply patches (e.g., from the `/patches` directory), first make your changes to the local dependency, then run:
>
> ```bash
> npx patch-package [package-name]
> ```
>
> These patches will be automatically re-applied on every `npm install`.

💁‍♂️ **Common Setup Issues**

Some devices may not support the latest `Node.js` version. If you see installation errors due to incompatible packages:

* Consider switching to Node.js **v18**, which is broadly compatible.
* Use a tool like [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Linux/macOS) or [`nvm-windows`](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) to manage multiple Node.js versions.

If individual packages fail to install, you can try:

* Installing them manually:

  ```bash
  npm install [package-name]
  ```
* Or using a pre-downloaded package: see [Use a Local Node Package](./tutorials/use_a_local_node_package.md)

#### 2.2 Install Python Modules

We recommend using `uv` for fast Python package management:

```bash
# Install uv (macOS/Linux)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Or with Homebrew
brew install uv
```

Then create the virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

This creates a `.venv` directory and installs all dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.

**Alternative (pip/conda):**

If you prefer traditional methods:

```bash
# Using conda
conda create -n mc python=3.13
conda activate mc
pip install javascript json5 requests fastapi uvicorn ultralytics torch Pillow

# Or using venv
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install javascript json5 requests fastapi uvicorn ultralytics torch Pillow
```

#### 2.3 Install Minecraft Client

1. Download and install [Minecraft Launcher](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft).
2. Minecraft AI supports **Minecraft Java Edition up to version 1.21.1**.
3. Launch Minecraft, create a world in the supported version, and open it to LAN (e.g., port `55916`).

### 3. Configure `settings.json`

Edit `settings.json` with the correct game connection settings:

```json
{
  "minecraft_version": "1.21.1",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 55916,
  "auth": "offline"
}
```

* `minecraft_version`: match your client version
* `host`: usually `localhost` or your machine’s IP
* `port`: must match the LAN world port

### 4. Create and Configure Bot Profiles

A bot profile defines an AI character's name, personality, and backend model. Set the profiles to activate in `settings.json`:

```json
"agents": ["./profiles/max.json"]
```

Here's a minimal example of `profiles/max.json`:

```json
{
    "username": "Max",
    "profile": "You are a smart Minecraft agent following your own heart...",
    "longterm_thinking": "I aim to become a reliable builder and problem-solver...",
    "self_driven_thinking_timer": 1000,
    "proposal_grace_period": 30,
    "resume_task_on_spawn": false,
    "skin": {"file": "./skins/max.png"},
    "llm": {
        "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "api_key": "env:OPENAI_API_KEY"
    },
    "modes": {
        "self_preservation": true,
        "unstuck": true,
        "cowardice": false,
        "self_defense": true,
        "auto_shield": true,
        "cheat": false,
        "high_jump": true
    },
    "cerebellum": {
        "narrate_behavior": false
    }
}
```

**Profile Configuration Fields:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `username` | Bot's in-game name |
| `profile` | Personality description |
| `longterm_thinking` | Long-term goals. **Can be empty** - will be auto-generated from profile on first spawn |
| `self_driven_thinking_timer` | Ticks between idle reflections. When `null`, only disables idle reflection (action completion and player message reflection still work) |
| `proposal_grace_period` | Seconds to wait before executing autonomous actions (default: 30) |
| `resume_task_on_spawn` | Resume unfinished tasks when bot reconnects (default: false) |
| `skin` | Bot skin configuration: `{"file": "path/to/skin.png"}` |
| `modes` | Behavioral mode configuration (see below) |
| `cerebellum` | Reflex system configuration (see below) |

🛎️ **It is recommended** to set `self_driven_thinking_timer` to an integer such as `100` or `1000`.

**Reflection Triggers:**
- **Action completion** - Always triggers reflection when a goal is completed or failed
- **Player message** - Always triggers reflection when receiving a message while idle
- **Idle timer** - Only triggers if `self_driven_thinking_timer` is not `null`

When `self_driven_thinking_timer` is **`null`**: The bot will NOT autonomously reflect while idle, but WILL reflect when finishing tasks or receiving player messages.

When `self_driven_thinking_timer` is **not `null`**: The bot will also reflect autonomously after the timer expires while idle.

The timer value represents the number of laps the bot should wait before idle reflection. A lap refers to one interval between two consecutive "time" events in the Mineflayer framework, which occurs approximately every `20` game ticks.
Since there are about `10,000` ticks per hour in Minecraft, you can estimate how long each interval lasts in real-world time by doing the math based on your `self_driven_thinking_timer` value.

🧠 **Identity Generation**: If `longterm_thinking` is empty or not provided, the agent will automatically generate its long-term goals from the profile on first spawn. This makes the agent "come alive" with derived aspirations that match its personality.

🤝 **Handshake Protocol**: When the agent wants to perform autonomous actions (self-driven tasks), it announces its intent and waits for the `proposal_grace_period` before executing. Players can interrupt by sending any message. This keeps the agent aligned with player intentions while still being proactive.

### Behavioral Modes

The bot has a reactive behavioral modes system that responds immediately to urgent situations. Configure modes in the profile:

```json
{
    "modes": {
        "self_preservation": true,
        "unstuck": true,
        "cowardice": false,
        "self_defense": true,
        "auto_shield": true,
        "cheat": false,
        "high_jump": true
    }
}
```

**Available Modes:**

| Mode | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `self_preservation` | ON | Respond to drowning, burning, and low health |
| `unstuck` | ON | Get unstuck when blocked for too long |
| `cowardice` | OFF | Run away from enemies (alternative to self_defense) |
| `self_defense` | ON | Attack nearby hostile enemies |
| `auto_shield` | OFF | Automatically raise shield to deflect incoming projectiles |
| `cheat` | OFF | Use cheats for instant block placement |
| `high_jump` | ON | Use water bucket clutch to survive high falls |

- **Reactive**: Modes run every tick (~1 second) for immediate response to urgent situations
- **Interruptible**: Modes like `self_preservation` and `self_defense` can interrupt any ongoing action
- **Web Monitor**: Mode states are displayed and can be toggled in real-time through the web interface

#### Auto Shield

The `auto_shield` mode enables the bot to automatically detect incoming projectiles (arrows, tridents, fireballs, etc.) and raise a shield to deflect them. Like `high_jump`, it runs in the cerebellum's physicsTick handler (~50ms) for fast response time.

**How it works:**
1. Every physics tick, scans for incoming projectile entities within detection range
2. When a projectile is detected heading toward the bot:
   - Equips a shield to the off-hand (if not already equipped)
   - Raises the shield by activating the off-hand item
   - Tracks the projectile and faces toward the threat
3. After the threat passes or is deflected, lowers the shield with a brief wind-down period

**Configuration:**
```json
{
    "modes": {
        "auto_shield": true
    }
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Bot must have a `shield` in inventory
- Mode must be ON (default: OFF)

#### Water Bucket Clutch (high_jump)

The `high_jump` mode enables the bot to automatically survive dangerous falls using the water bucket clutch technique. It runs in the cerebellum's physicsTick handler (~50ms) for the fast response time the maneuver requires.

**How it works:**
1. Every physics tick, checks if the bot is falling (`velocity.y < -0.5`)
2. Scans downward to find the first solid block below
3. Skips the clutch if already in water, on a ladder/vine/scaffolding, in creative mode, or landing on safe blocks (slime, hay bale, water, etc.)
4. When within 3-6 blocks of the ground (scaled by velocity) and fall distance > 3 blocks:
   - Looks straight down
   - Places water on the ground block
5. After landing safely, picks up the water with the empty bucket

**Nether support:**
- In the Nether, water evaporates. The bot automatically uses a `powder_snow_bucket` instead, falling back to a regular water bucket if unavailable.

**Configuration:**
```json
{
    "modes": {
        "high_jump": true
    }
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Bot must have a `water_bucket` in inventory (or `powder_snow_bucket` for Nether)
- Mode must be ON (default: ON)

### Cerebellum (Reflex System)

The Cerebellum is a high-frequency reflex system that handles automatic responses. It runs every tick and provides immediate reactive behaviors without LLM calls.

Configure it in the profile:

```json
{
    "cerebellum": {
        "narrate_behavior": false
    }
}
```

**Cerebellum Configuration:**

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `narrate_behavior` | `false` | If `true`, prints attack completion logs to console |

The Cerebellum works alongside the modes system:
- **Self-preservation reflexes**: Escape fire, lava, surface when drowning
- **Self-defense reflexes**: Attack nearby hostile entities
- **Attack cooldown**: 8-second cooldown between self-defense attacks on the same target

### Web Viewer (First-Person Camera)

You can enable a web-based viewer to see what the bot sees in real-time. Add these fields to your bot profile:

```json
{
    "viewer_port": 3000,
    "viewer_first_person": true,
    "viewer_distance": 6
}
```

**Viewer Configuration:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `viewer_port` | Port for the web viewer (e.g., 3000) |
| `viewer_first_person` | Set to `true` for first-person view |
| `viewer_distance` | Render distance in chunks (default: 6) |

After starting the bot, open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the bot's view.

### Web Monitor

The Web Monitor provides a browser-based dashboard to view bot status, toggle behavioral modes, and monitor activity in real-time.

Enable it in `settings.json`:

```json
{
    "web_monitor": {
        "enabled": true,
        "port": 8080,
        "state_write_interval_ms": 500,
        "viewer_enabled": true
    }
}
```

**Web Monitor Configuration:**

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `false` | Enable/disable the web monitor |
| `port` | `8080` | Port for the web interface |
| `state_write_interval_ms` | `500` | How often to update bot state |
| `viewer_enabled` | `true` | Enable/disable 3D world viewer in monitor |

After starting the bot, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to access the monitor.

**Features:**
- View all connected bots and their status
- See bot health, hunger, position, and inventory
- Toggle behavioral modes in real-time
- Monitor current goals and actions
- 3D world viewer (when `viewer_enabled` is true)

**Prerequisites:**
- Python dependencies: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
# or with uv
uv add fastapi uvicorn
```

### Vision System (Object Detection)

The Vision System allows the bot to "see" and understand its environment using multiple detection backends. Detected objects are included in the bot's decision-making context.

#### Supported Detectors

| Detector | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `yolo` | YOLOv10 with LLM translation (default) | General object detection with intelligent Minecraft context |
| `rtdetr` | RT-DETR object detection | General object detection |
| `vlm` | Vision Language Model | Rich scene understanding via API |

#### Enable Vision

Add the `vision` configuration to your bot profile:

```json
{
    "viewer_port": 3000,
    "viewer_first_person": true,
    "vision": {
        "enabled": true,
        "detector": "yolo",
        "model": "yolov10n.pt",
        "confidence_threshold": 0.3,
        "cache_ttl_seconds": 2,
        "max_saved_screenshots": 10
    }
}
```

**Vision Configuration:**

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `false` | Enable/disable vision system |
| `detector` | `"yolo"` | Detector type: `yolo`, `rtdetr`, or `vlm` |
| `model` | (varies) | Model URL or path for yolo/rtdetr; API model name for vlm |
| `confidence_threshold` | `0.3` | Minimum confidence for detections (yolo/rtdetr only) |
| `cache_ttl_seconds` | `2` | Cache TTL to avoid redundant captures |
| `max_saved_screenshots` | `10` | Max screenshots to keep (0 = keep none) |
| `vlm` | `{}` | VLM-specific config (see below) |

**Prerequisites:**
- `viewer_port` must be set (required for screenshot capability)
- Python dependencies: `ultralytics`, `torch`, `Pillow` (included in `pyproject.toml`)

#### YOLO Detector (Default)

YOLOv10 is the default detector, using a general-purpose model trained on the COCO dataset (80 real-world object classes). Raw detections are passed to the LLM with a translation guide, allowing intelligent interpretation in Minecraft context.

```json
{
    "vision": {
        "enabled": true,
        "detector": "yolo",
        "model": "yolov10n.pt",
        "confidence_threshold": 0.3
    }
}
```

**How it works:**
1. YOLOv10 detects objects using real-world labels (e.g., "person", "cow", "sheep")
2. Detection results are included in the LLM prompt with a translation guide
3. The LLM interprets labels in Minecraft context using its knowledge of the game

**Available YOLOv10 Models (auto-downloaded by ultralytics on first use):**

| Model | Size | Speed | Accuracy |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| `yolov10n.pt` | 5.8MB | Fastest | Good (default) |
| `yolov10s.pt` | ~15MB | Faster | Better |
| `yolov10m.pt` | ~30MB | Balanced | Better |
| `yolov10l.pt` | ~60MB | Slower | Best |
| `yolov10x.pt` | ~80MB | Slowest | Best |

> **Download:** YOLOv10 models are auto-downloaded by ultralytics on first use. You can also manually download them from the [ultralytics assets releases](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases) and place the `.pt` file in the `models/` directory.

**Custom Models:**

You can also use a custom model by providing a URL or local path:

```json
{
    "vision": {
        "enabled": true,
        "detector": "yolo",
        "model": "https://your-server.com/custom-model.pt"
    }
}
```

#### RT-DETR Detector

General-purpose object detection (similar to YOLO but using DETR architecture):

```json
{
    "vision": {
        "enabled": true,
        "detector": "rtdetr",
        "model": "https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/rtdetr-l.pt",
        "confidence_threshold": 0.3
    }
}
```

**Available RT-DETR Models:**

| Model | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `rtdetr-l.pt` | ~64 MB | Large (recommended) |
| `rtdetr-x.pt` | ~130 MB | Extra large, most accurate |

> **Download:** RT-DETR models are auto-downloaded by ultralytics on first use. You can also manually download them from the [ultralytics assets releases](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases) and place the `.pt` file in the `models/` directory:
> - `rtdetr-l.pt` — [download](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/rtdetr-l.pt)
> - `rtdetr-x.pt` — [download](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/rtdetr-x.pt)

> **Note:** Like YOLO, RT-DETR is a general-purpose detector using COCO labels. The LLM interprets these in Minecraft context.

#### VLM Detector (Vision Language Model)

Rich scene understanding using LLM APIs:

```json
{
    "vision": {
        "enabled": true,
        "detector": "vlm",
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "vlm": {
            "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
            "api_key": "env:OPENAI_API_KEY",
            "prompt": "Describe what you see in this Minecraft scene..."
        }
    }
}
```

**VLM Configuration:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `vlm.base_url` | API base URL (falls back to agent's `llm.base_url`) |
| `vlm.api_key` | API key (supports `env:VAR_NAME` prefix) |
| `vlm.prompt` | Custom prompt for vision analysis (optional) |

**First Run:**
For YOLOv10 models (e.g., `yolov10n.pt`), ultralytics automatically downloads the model on first use - no manual confirmation needed.

For custom model URLs, you'll see:
```
[Vision] Model download required
  Model: custom-model.pt
  Size: ~XX MB
  Available disk space: 50000 MB

  This model will be downloaded.
Download the vision model? [y/N]:
```

Type `y` to download, or `n` to start without vision.

**Vision in Action:**
When the bot makes decisions, it receives visual context with translation guide:
```
## Visual Observation (YOLO Detection - COCO Dataset)

You see the following objects through your vision system.
**Important:** This uses a general-purpose YOLOv10 model trained on real-world objects.

### Translation Guide:
- 'person' → player, villager, zombie, skeleton, or other humanoid mob
- 'cow', 'sheep', 'pig' → corresponding passive Minecraft mobs
...

### Detected objects:
- person x1 (center-middle, confidence: 89%)
- cow x2 (positions: left-middle, right-middle, avg confidence: 72%)
```

The LLM then interprets "person" based on context (e.g., "the player who just messaged me" vs "a nearby zombie").

### 5. Configure LLM Provider

The `llm` configuration in the bot profile supports any OpenAI-compatible API. You can configure:

- `base_url`: The API endpoint URL
- `model`: The model identifier
- `api_key`: Your API key (use `env:VAR_NAME` to read from environment variable)

#### Setting API Keys

You can set API keys directly or use environment variables:

```json
"llm": {
    "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "api_key": "env:OPENAI_API_KEY"
}
```

Then export the environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key-here"
```

> 🔐 **Best Practice**: Use environment variables (`env:VAR_NAME`) instead of hardcoding keys in profile files.

#### Tag-Specific Provider Configuration

You can configure different LLM providers for different tasks by adding tag-specific overrides:

```json
{
    "llm": {
        "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "api_key": "env:OPENAI_API_KEY",
        "memory": {
            "model": "gpt-4o-mini"
        },
        "reflection": {
            "base_url": "https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3",
            "model": "doubao-1-5-pro-32k-250115",
            "api_key": "env:DOUBAO_API_KEY"
        },
        "decide": {
            "model": "gpt-4o"
        },
        "new_action": {
            "model": "gpt-4o"
        }
    }
}
```

Available tags:
- **`memory`**: Used for memory summarization tasks
- **`reflection`**: Used for self-driven thinking and reflection
- **`decide`**: Used for action decision making
- **`new_action`**: Used for generating custom Python actions (coding tasks)

Each tag inherits from the default `llm` config and only overrides the fields you specify.

#### Supported Providers and Base URLs

All providers use OpenAI-compatible APIs. Just set the `base_url` and `model` in your profile:

> **Note:** All providers use the standard OpenAI `/chat/completions` endpoint. The `call_openai_compatible_api` function handles this automatically.

#### Example Configurations

**OpenAI:**
```json
"llm": {
    "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "api_key": "env:OPENAI_API_KEY"
}
```

**Anthropic:**
```json
"llm": {
    "base_url": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "api_key": "env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
}
```

**DeepSeek:**
```json

    "base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com",
    "model": "deepseek-chat",
    "api_key": "env:DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"
}
```

**Doubao (with cheaper model for memory):**
```json
"llm": {
    "base_url": "https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3",
    "model": "doubao-1-5-pro-32k-250115",
    "api_key": "env:DOUBAO_API_KEY",
    "memory": {
        "model": "doubao-1-5-lite-32k-250115"
    }
}
```

**Pollinations (free, no API key required):**
```json
"llm": {
    "base_url": "https://text.pollinations.ai/openai",
    "model": "openai-large",
    "api_key": ""
}
```

**Ollama (local, no API key required):**
```json
"llm": {

    "model": "llama3.2",
    "api_key": ""
}
```

### 6. Start the Bot System

Once everything is configured, start the agent system:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see the AI agent(s) connect and say "Hi, I am [bot's name]!" or ("Found tasks not finished") within your Minecraft world!

### Common Errors

#### `ECONNRESET` (Code `-4077`)

This usually means your `minecraft_version` setting does not match the running game. Double-check that you are using:

* Minecraft Java Edition version `1.21.1`
* And the corresponding value in `settings.json`:

```json
"minecraft_version": "1.21.1"
```

**Recommended Fix**

* Use **Minecraft Java Edition `1.21.1`**
* Ensure the `minecraft_version` field in `settings.json` exactly matches the version of your running Minecraft world:

```json
"minecraft_version": "1.21.1"
```
